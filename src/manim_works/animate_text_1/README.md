## Input
The script needs a text file as input. `sentences.txt`
- In this file, you must write the sentences you want to animate as text.
- Run the Python script, and in the output folder, you will find all the MP4 files.

## output
- Each sentence is saved as a separate MP4 file.
- The filename follows this format: "sentence + _ + sentence number".
- Having separate MP4 files allows for a modular way of creating videos.
- you can join all mp4 files as well.
- You can overlay these text animations on each scene easily. 
  - Use chroma key in your video editor to filter black background.
  - Then you will only see the letters without background
