## Input
The script needs a text file as input. `sentences.txt`
- In this file, you must write the sentences you want to animate as text.
- Run the Python script, and in the output folder, you will find all the MP4 files.

## output
- Each sentence is saved as a separate MP4 file.
- The filename follows this format: "sentence + sentence number".
- Having separate MP4 files allows for a modular way of creating videos.
- You can overlay these text animations on each scene easily.
